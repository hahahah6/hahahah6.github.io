In the **2024 National College Student Electronic Design Competition**, we participated in the **Information Technology Frontier Topic** category and designed an innovative **Automated Potted Plant Cultivation System Based on Deep Imaging**. This system uses **deep imaging technology** and **multi-sensor integration** to monitor and manage key growth parameters of potted plants, such as soil moisture, temperature, and plant health.

The system is composed of several key modules:

* **Sensing Module**: Includes soil, atmospheric, spectral, and depth cameras intel d455 for accurate data collection.
* **Automation Module**: Uses a conveyor belt and robotic arm for continuous and automated plant testing and analysis.
* **Control Module**: Powered by the **Renesas RZ/G2L development board** and assisted by **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**, this module handles data processing and control.
* **Human-Machine Interaction Module**: Provides both local and cloud-based interfaces, offering real-time data visualization and remote monitoring.

This system represents a significant advancement in the automated monitoring and cultivation of potted plants, offering a solution that is both cost-effective and scalable, suitable for both small-scale and commercial plant production. We were honored to receive the **National First Prize** for our innovative approach in promoting precision agriculture and advancing the digital economy in agriculture.
