In the 2024 National College Student Electronic Design Competition, where we developed a high-throughput phenotyping monitoring system for potted plants. Our project aimed to address the challenges of traditional plant cultivation by implementing a system capable of real-time monitoring of key growth parameters, such as plant height, soil nutrition, and overall plant health.

The hardware architecture included a Renesas RA6M5 microcontroller as the central control unit, with various sensors integrated into the system, including soil, spectral, and laser sensors. These sensors enabled the collection of real-time data, which was processed and analyzed to optimize water and fertilizer usage through dynamic control. The system also featured a cloud-based human-computer interaction interface built with Vue.js, allowing remote monitoring and control of plant conditions.

The system’s innovative design incorporated a combination of custom peripherals, 3D imaging technology, and sensor networks to provide accurate and efficient monitoring. This integration of cutting-edge technology has the potential to transform potted plant cultivation, moving towards automated, IoT-driven solutions for both household and industrial-scale applications.

We were proud to be awarded the First Prize in the Eastern Division for our work in advancing digital agriculture and promoting the development of precision farming systems.
