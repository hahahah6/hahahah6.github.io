In the 2023 National College Student Electronic Design Competition, we participated in the "E-Topic" category, where we developed an innovative project focused on laser vision tracking. Our project featured a sophisticated dual-gimbal system composed of two cloud platforms (gimbals) with a total of four brushless DC motors, all integrated using 3D printed structural components to form a comprehensive two-axis gimbal system.

The hardware architecture consisted of two ESP32 microcontrollers, each responsible for controlling one gimbal platform, ensuring precise and responsive motor control. For the vision processing system, we employed both Orange Pi and NVIDIA Jetson platforms to handle complex computer vision tasks, including laser detection and real-time tracking algorithms using Python and OpenCV.

The 3D printed framework provided a lightweight yet robust structure that allowed for smooth and accurate positioning across both axes. The dual ESP32 configuration enabled distributed control, improving system responsiveness and reliability for laser tracking applications.

We were honored to receive the Second Prize for our innovative integration of multiple hardware platforms and advanced control algorithms!
