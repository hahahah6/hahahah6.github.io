In the 2023 National College Student Electronic Design Competition, we participated in the "E-Topic" category, where we developed an innovative project focused on laser vision tracking. Our project involved the integration of various hardware components, including an ESP32, Orange Pi, and NVIDIA Jetson, alongside a brushless DC motor. The system was designed to track a moving laser in real time with high precision, leveraging advanced computer vision algorithms and hardware interfacing.

Our setup utilized the ESP32 for real-time processing and control, while the Orange Pi and Jetson handled the more complex tasks of image processing and machine vision, using tools like Python and OpenCV for laser detection and tracking. The brushless DC motor was controlled using precise algorithms to ensure smooth motion and accurate tracking of the laser's position.

we were honored to receive the Second Prize for our efforts!
